# Skeight
## Game Developed using Phaser 3, Webpack, and ES6.

Implementation of an Endless game built with [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) framework.

On this project, I've built an easy-play platform game where your player, a rebel skate girl, has to avoid the police and the obstacles while collecting beers to gain points. There are some standard tricks you can do while combining arrow keyboards.
Local storage was used to store the username, and Leaderboard API is used to track the highest scores.
